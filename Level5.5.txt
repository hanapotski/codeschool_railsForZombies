NAMED ROUTE
Create a named route. It should generate a path like '/zombies/:name' where :name is a parameter, and points to the index action in ZombiesController. Name the route 'graveyard'

TwitterForZombies::Application.routes.draw do
  get '/zombies/:name', to: 'zombies#index', :as => 'graveyard'
end
